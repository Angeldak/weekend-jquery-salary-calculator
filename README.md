# Salary Calculator

## Description
Duration: 3 hours

This project takes in employee information and does a monthly payroll cost calculation on their annual salary.  It also alerts the user if the monthly payroll cost has exceeded $20,000.  

Employees can be added by both admin and regular users.  While it does require admin access to delete employee information.

With features like "press enter to submit", clicking table header to sort, and validation checks on both missing information and duplicate employee ID's, this project can help manage even the most untidy of employee lists!
